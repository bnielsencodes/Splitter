## My Process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued Development

I really wanted to use React with this project, but am not comfortable enough with it yet so I stuck to HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. I plan on continuing to improve my React skills and knowledge so I can feel more confident to use it on future projects.
